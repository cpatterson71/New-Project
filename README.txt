Not sure exactly what happened here.  It is my fault, I just do not have the time for something I am not familiar with.  Hopefully, phython will go a little better.  Feedback on how close I was to the solution would work.  Trying to give a summary of my thought process below:
  1. break the problem into smaller workable solutions
  2. Set my variables
  3. Have each smaller problem its own Function, thought it would be easier to break apart, but may have been a problem if having to re-state variables throughout the program
  4. use resources from class, web, forum, etc. to create a draft of the code.
  5. de-bug and figure any solutions.
  6. If I could not figure out on my own, then ask for help.
  7. go back and work on program

Hope this helps, not exactly sure what it is.  Probably, just off by a letter or number to make it workable.
  Thanks,
